# week 2

## day 1
- Today I struggled a lot with connecting the app with facebook. It should be nearly done by now. I hope I can finish it tomorow.

## day 2
- Hash Key problem solved. Now I can login with my laptop(emulator) and my phone into facebook. I will have to figure out how to make the app available for other devices to login in a later stadium. For now I can test the app in a developer environment.
