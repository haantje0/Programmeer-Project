# week 2

## day 1
- Today I struggled a lot with connecting the app with facebook. It should be nearly done by now. I hope I can finish it tomorow.

## day 2
- Hash Key problem solved. Now I can login with my laptop(emulator) and my phone into facebook. I will have to figure out how to make the app available for other devices to login in a later stadium. For now I can test the app in a developer environment.
- A part of the firebase code which adds a new item to a collection is implemented. 
- I tried to make a new branch in firebase for a new facebook user, but it does not work yet.

## day 3
- The facebook login is working now. There is a problem with the connection with firebase, which makes it sometimes load infinitly long, and sometimes it works fine. I will try to find a solution for that later.
- I can save data in the firebase database. This works withouth the dynamic specs.
